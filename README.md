My Etch-A-Sketch project!!

This is a virtual and rudimentary version of the mechanical drawing toy Etch-A-Sketch. It consists of 5 main functions and 4 complementary functions (in parenthesis):
    - canvas (trailColor).
    - clearTrail.
    - resize.
    - random (setColors and randomRGB).
    - opacity (incOpacity).

Each function, except for "canvas" which displays the drawing space, can be triggered by clicking on the correspondant option in the UI and will allow to clear the drawing space, resize the grid, draw with random colors or use a grayscale, depending on the user's choice.

At the end of this project, the noob will be able to work with the DOM, create grids, and add events to different elements in the UI.

This task corresponds to the Javascript Basics module of the Odin Project Web development 101.
